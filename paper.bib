abstract = {ABSTRACT As individuals are exposed to a myriad of potentially harmful pollutants every day, it is important to determine which actors have the greatest influence on health outcomes. However, jointly modeling the associations of multiple pollutant exposures is often hindered by the presence of highly correlated chemicals originating from a common source. A popular approach to analyzing associations between a disease outcome and several highly correlated exposures is Weighted Quantile Sum Regression (WQSR) modeling. WQSR provides increased stability in estimating model parameters but requires data splitting to estimate individual and group effects of chemicals, which reduces the power of the approach. A recent Bayesian implementation of WQSR regression provides a model fitting procedure that avoids data splitting at the cost of high computational expense on large data. In this paper, we introduce a Frequentist Grouped Weighted Quantile Sum Regression (FGWQSR) model that can be fitted efficiently to large datasets without requiring data splitting. FGWQSR produces estimates of the joint effect of mixture groups and of individual chemicals, and likelihood-ratio-based tests that account for FGWQSR's non-standard asymptotics. We demonstrate that FGWQSR is well calibrated for type-I errors while outperforming both Bayesian Grouped Weighted Quantile Sum Regression and Quantile Logistic Regression in terms of statistical power to detect the effects of mixture groups and individual chemicals. In addition, we show that FGWQSR is robust to model misspecification and can be fitted on large datasets in a fraction of the time required for BGWQSR. We apply FGWQSR to a dataset of 317 767 mother-child pairs with exposure profiles generated by chemical transport models to study the associations between several components found in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 μm\$\$ \mu \mathrm{m} \$\$ (PM 2.5\$\$ {}\_{2.5} \$\$) and child Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis before age 5. PM 2.5\$\$ {}\_{2.5} \$\$ copper and PM 2.5\$\$ {}\_{2.5} \$\$ crustal material are found to be statistically significantly associated with ASD diagnosis by five years of age.},

ABSTRACT = {Individuals are exposed to a large number of diverse environmental chemicals simultaneously and the evaluation of multiple chemical exposures is important for identifying cancer risk factors. The measurement of a large number of chemicals (the exposome) in epidemiologic studies is allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of cancer risk factors than was done in earlier studies that focused on only a few chemicals. Empirical evidence from epidemiologic studies shows that chemicals from different chemical classes have different magnitudes and directions of association with cancers. Given increasing data availability, there is a need for the development and assessment of statistical methods to model environmental cancer risk that considers a large number of diverse chemicals with different effects for different chemical classes. The method of grouped weighted quantile sum (GWQS) regression allows for multiple groups of chemicals to be considered in the model such that different magnitudes and directions of associations are possible for each group of chemicals. In this paper, we assessed the ability of GWQS regression to estimate exposure effects for multiple chemical groups and correctly identify important chemicals in each group using a simulation study. We compared the performance of GWQS regression with WQS regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), and the group lasso in estimating exposure effects and identifying important chemicals. The simulation study results demonstrate that GWQS is an effective method for modeling exposure to multiple groups of chemicals and compares favorably with other methods used in mixture analysis. As an application, we used GWQS regression in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS), a population-based case-control study of childhood leukemia in California to estimate exposure effects for many chemical classes while also adjusting for demographic factors. The CCLS analysis found evidence of a positive association between exposure to the herbicide dacthal and an increased risk of childhood leukemia.},

ABSTRACT = {There has been a growing interest in the literature on multiple environmental risk factors for diseases and an increasing emphasis on assessing multiple environmental exposures simultaneously in epidemiologic studies of cancer. One method used to analyze exposure to multiple chemical exposures is weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. While WQS regression has been demonstrated to have good sensitivity and specificity when identifying important exposures, it has limitations including a two-step model fitting process that decreases power and model stability and a requirement that all exposures in the weighted index have associations in the same direction with the outcome, which is not realistic when chemicals in different classes have different directions and magnitude of association with a health outcome. Grouped WQS (GWQS) was proposed to allow for multiple groups of chemicals in the model where different magnitude and direction of associations are possible for each group. However, GWQS shares the limitation of WQS of a two-step estimation process and splitting of data into training and validation sets. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian group index model to avoid the estimation limitation of GWQS while having multiple exposure indices in the model. To evaluate the performance of the Bayesian group index model, we conducted a simulation study with several different exposure scenarios. We also applied the Bayesian group index method to analyze childhood leukemia risk in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS). The results showed that the Bayesian group index model had slightly better power for exposure effects and specificity and sensitivity in identifying important chemical exposure components compared with the existing frequentist method, particularly for small sample sizes. In the application to the CCLS, we found a significant negative association for insecticides, with the most important chemical being carbaryl. In addition, for children who were born and raised in the home where dust samples were taken, there was a significant positive association for herbicides with dacthal being the most important exposure. In conclusion, our approach of the Bayesian group index model appears able to make a substantial contribution to the field of environmental epidemiology.},

The main drawback is the release of harmful gasses like HC, CO, NOx and particulate matter into the atmosphere. This affects both human beings and environment to a great extent and should be controlled effectively. This paper reviews the works on the control of diesel particulate matter in both pre-combustion and post-combustion techniques employed in the past few decades. The initial part of this review will discuss particulate matter composition and its structure. Then the various physical processes involved in the formation of particulate matter are discussed. Effects of fuel composition and its structure on soot formation are reported. Hazardous effects of particulate matter on both human beings and the environment are reviewed. Use of biodiesel water emulsified fuel as a fuel to control soot formation is highlighted. This review also highlights control of particulate matter by varying injection parameters like injection pressure, injection timing and auxiliary air injection. Multiple fuel injections within the same cycle to control NOx and particulate matter are also discussed. The conventional control technique of particulate matter by using Diesel particulate filter and its types are also compared with the new technologies. Various regeneration concepts to burn the collected soot are also highlighted. The major part of this review focuses on pre-combustion techniques to control particulate matter. This review paper, it is hoped, will be very useful for the researchers working on the control of diesel particulate matter.}
