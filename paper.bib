It is based on the gradient projection method and uses a limited memory BFGS matrix to approximate the Hessian of the objective function. It is shown how to take advantage of the form of the limited memory approximation to implement the algorithm efficiently. The results of numerical tests on a set of large problems are reported. }

abstract = {The diesel engine is being widely used in day to day life in both mobile and stationary applications. The main drawback is the release of harmful gasses like HC, CO, NOx and particulate matter into the atmosphere. This affects both human beings and environment to a great extent and should be controlled effectively. This paper reviews the works on the control of diesel particulate matter in both pre-combustion and post-combustion techniques employed in the past few decades. The initial part of this review will discuss particulate matter composition and its structure. Then the various physical processes involved in the formation of particulate matter are discussed. Effects of fuel composition and its structure on soot formation are reported. Hazardous effects of particulate matter on both human beings and the environment are reviewed. Use of biodiesel water emulsified fuel as a fuel to control soot formation is highlighted. This review also highlights control of particulate matter by varying injection parameters like injection pressure, injection timing and auxiliary air injection. Multiple fuel injections within the same cycle to control NOx and particulate matter are also discussed. The conventional control technique of particulate matter by using Diesel particulate filter and its types are also compared with the new technologies. Various regeneration concepts to burn the collected soot are also highlighted. The major part of this review focuses on pre-combustion techniques to control particulate matter. This review paper, it is hoped, will be very useful for the researchers working on the control of diesel particulate matter.}
